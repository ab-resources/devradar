<!-- /TOC -->

A full open source solution to build a custom technology radar as pioneered by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).
See [radar-demo.anoff.io](https://radar-demo.anoff.io) for an authentication free test environment.

The master branch of this repository holds a devradar version customized towards showing my [personal technology](https://radar.anoff.io) set.
For building a teams or organizations techradar it might be better to stick with the original _Hold_, _Assess_, _Trial_, _Adopt_ style.

## Features

- [x] add new blips
- [x] modify blips
- [x] render tech blips on radar
- [x] show blip history
- [x] make radar categories customizable

You can reach an entire demo site where you can try the radar features on [radar-demo.anoff.io](//radar-demo.anoff.io)
## Design

The main part is a static Vue.js application using Firebase as backend and authentication provider.

Database schema

![firestore schema](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/anoff/devradar/master/assets/firestore.puml)

## Create your own

### Customize

All aspects of the radar can be customized via a few files.
In the future I hope to consolidate it into a single configuration file.
The main files to customize are [the config](src/config.js), [the stylesheet](src/assets/radar.scss) and [database security rules](firestore.rules). The latter is only relevant when using the firebase backend.
The **theme colors** together with the labels for **categories** and required **permissions** to access specific resources can be found in the config.

The stylesheet can be modified to change the **radar colors** or the size/responsiveness.

### Setup

See [setup.md](setup.md) for detailed setup instructions.
