During a Hackathon in October 2018 within a group of 4 I was in charge of prototyping and developing a control interface for a ROS based humanoid robot arm by Festo.

This gave insights into how the framework is structured into topics, services etc as well as first experience in what a good ROS architecture looks like.

By delivering a working prototype with a valid new use case for the existing product we won the Festo challenge. The source code as well as a demo video can be found on the [R.I.C GitHub repository](https://github.com/anoff/ric)"""
